## Overview of the Analysis
This project takes place in a lending startup where the company needs help on valuing loans automatically. We are now creating a Python program to automate tasks involving valuing microcredit loans for a lending startup. The stages that are involved in this program are the following: 
    1. Automate the Calculations for the loan portfolio summaries.
    2. Analyze Loan Data to determine investment evaluation
    3. Perform Financial Calculations using Python functions
    4. Conditionally filter lists of loans iterate through a series of loans and select only the inexpensive loans
    5. Save the results in a csv file named "inexpensive_loans.csv"
